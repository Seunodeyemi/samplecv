                <h3>Programming Tools</h3>

                <p>As a core statistician, I can say R is my first programming language because it brings statistical theory to life. I have more the 10 years of experience coding in R while still improving myself. The simplicity of its syntax and availability
                    of resource community makes my use of R very smooth. I can say I have not seen any analytics problem that R cannot handle when given time to research (I stand to be challenged). <br> <strong>Rating:</strong>‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

                <p> On SQL I can say my journey as a Business analyst has been great because of my knowledge in SQL. Deploying analytics projects in two major financial institutions in Nigeria improved my skills in this, while I always learn to catch up with updates.
                    It is one of the tools I find so comfortable to use in creating procedures, data preparation for BI reports, etc.<br>

                <p>I started using Python about half a decade ago mainly for Data Science projects. I have undergone training in stock market predictive analysis with Python, using libraries such as Sklearn, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, etc. Sometimes I prefer Python for
                    data wrangling activities because of its syntax as seen in list comprehension, Piping, and web scraping libraries, and its capacity to integrate well with applications.<br> <strong>Rating:</strong>‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

                <p>My knowledge of Powerbi is as deep as automating a financial institution's monthly report such that it is updated and rendered to all stakeholders daily. This led to about a 50% increase in the rate of decision-making and call
                    to action. <br><strong>Rating:</strong>‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
                </p>
                <p>Haven't said all, there are other programming languages and tools that I have built capacity on over the years platforms such as Visual Studio (which was used in designing this website), Microsoft Power platform, google platforms and languages
                    such as HTML, PHP, .Net, X++, C#, etc. Like I always say,
                    <strong><em>I am into programming because here is where whatever you can think of is possible. All you need is time to learn and experiment.</em></strong>
